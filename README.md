# Sprint-Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I listen to what the user requires from the program. Even if they aren't able to voice their wants or needs in a way that fits nicely into code, it's part of my job to do the interpretation for them. If they want a certain feature then I go about finding a way to make that happen in the program. User stories help by giving us something to work toward. It also usually has a test feature that makes sure that what the client wants is actually fulfilled by our program. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs by starting small and then working towards the bigger picture. Outlining the program beforehand helps a lot with this. Building the basic framework of the program before beginning to work towards the more complex parts of the program. Agile processes I like to use is creating time sprints for myself to work. I also run tests every so often or debugging to make sure that I don't have to do a lot of extra work at the end. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means being able to adapt to the needs of clients and change job roles when necessary. It also means being a good communicator so that teammates understand what I'm working on and how they can help or vice versa.
